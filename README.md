**Rich Converter**:
Specifically intended to convert the .ass tags in .ass files into Rich Text tags for stream compatibility

_When to use_:
1) ONLY if your file contains .ass tags that are not standard (e.g {\c&H00FF00&} and need to be converted to the RICH TEXT equivalent (e.g <color=#00FF00>)
2) If you already use Rich text, do not use this, it won't work.

**YTT to VTT Converter**:
Specifically intended to convert the .ytt file to .vtt file for the purpose of testing subtitles locally

_When to use_:
1) ONLY if you have already converted your Subtitle format (.ass, .srt etc...) to .ytt and need to test your subtitles on Stream - This converts ytt to xml to vtt. If you don't want to generate an XML, do not tick the option for this
2) If you do not plan to test locally, then do not use this, it will not help you further.
